1,,wedding,,,"When attending a wedding, you should wear light and elegant. Avoid all white as it is reserved for the bride, and avoid all black for an Asian wedding as it is considered inappropriate.  An example outfit can be a sheer light pink dress with pearl earrings and nude heels for women, while men can wear a navy blue suit with a crisp white shirt and brown leather shoes."
2,,business,,,"For a business meeting, you should wear polished and professional. Avoid overly casual attire like jeans, sneakers, or flashy accessories. Stick to neutral or dark colors like navy, black, or gray. A well-fitted blazer paired with a white button-down shirt and tailored trousers is ideal for both men and women. Women can opt for closed-toe heels, while men should wear formal dress shoes. Keep accessories minimal to maintain a refined look."
3,,fine dining,,,"When dining at a fine restaurant, you should wear something sophisticated and stylish. Avoid overly casual clothing like t-shirts, sneakers, or distressed jeans. Stick to elegant evening wear—women can opt for a knee-length cocktail dress with statement jewelry and heels. Men should wear a tailored suit or a smart blazer with dress pants and leather shoes. Dark, solid colors or subtle patterns are best. Accessories should be understated, and avoid heavy fragrances."
4,,music festival,,,"For a music festival, you should wear something trendy and comfortable that allows for movement. Avoid heavy fabrics, high heels, or tight-fitting clothing that restricts mobility. Opt for breathable, lightweight outfits—women can wear a bohemian crop top with high-waisted denim shorts and ankle boots, while men can choose a relaxed graphic tee with cargo shorts and sneakers. Layer with a light jacket for unpredictable weather, and accessorize with sunglasses and a crossbody bag."
5,,date,,,"For a date, you should wear something stylish yet comfortable that reflects your personality. Avoid overly casual or overly formal attire—find a balance based on the date location. A fitted dress with a soft cardigan and elegant flats or heels works well for women. Men can opt for a button-up shirt with well-fitted jeans and loafers. Stick to warm, romantic colors like red, burgundy, or soft pastels, and keep accessories subtle and refined."
